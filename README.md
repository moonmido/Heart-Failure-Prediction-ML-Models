# Heart-Failure-Prediction-ML-Models
A machine learning project to predict heart failure risk using multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN). Models are evaluated with emphasis on recall to minimize false negatives, ensuring better detection of high-risk patients.
